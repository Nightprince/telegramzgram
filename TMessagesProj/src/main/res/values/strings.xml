    <string name="ReportAnswer1">زمانی که تعدادی از کابران پیام های ناخواسته از یک حساب را گزارش می کنند، تلگرام یک محدودیت برای این حساب اعمال می کند. حساب های گزارش شده فقط می توانند به افرادی که شماره آن ها را دارند پیام ارسال کنند. تلگرام این محدودیت را برای جلوگیری از تبلیغات و آرامش کاربران اعمال کرده است. این محدودیت در سمت سرور اعمال می شود و اپلیکیشن ما هیچ دخالتی در آن ندارد.</string>
    <string name="ReportAnswer2">اگر این اتفاق برای اولین بار است که برای شما افتاده است، به احتمال زیاد حساب شما بعد از حدود یک هفته از محدودیت خارج می شود. تکرار این اتفاق مدت بیشتری شما را محدود خواهد کرد. و اگر به ارسال پیام های ناخواسته ادامه دهید ممکن است این محدودیت همیشگی شود.</string>
    <string name="ReportAnswer3">در حال حاضر بهترین راهی که تلگرام برای رفع این محدودیت ارائه کرده است، استفاده از ربات رسمی تلگرام (Spam Bot( است. با انتخاب گزینه زیر می توانید وارد ربات شده و با استفاده از دستورات ربات مشکل خود را اعلام و پیگیری نمایید.</string>
    <string name="ReportAnswer4">خیر این محدودیت بر روی شماره شما و در سمت سرور اعمال شده است و با خروج از حساب و یا حذف حساب و یا استفاده از برنامه تلگرامی دیگر نیز مشکل برطرف نمی شود.</string>

    <string name="ReportQuestion2">سوال: حالا باید چیکار کنم؟</string>
    <string name="ReportQuestion3">سوال: من مطمئنم که اشتباهی رخ داده و این محدودیت به اشتباه بر روی حساب من اعمال شده است.</string>
    <string name="ReportQuestion4">سوال: با حذف حساب تلگرامی هم مشکل حل نمی شود؟</string>
